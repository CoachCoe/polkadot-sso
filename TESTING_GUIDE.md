# ðŸ§ª Testing Guide for Polkadot SSO Credentials System

This guide covers all the different ways to test your Polkadot SSO credentials system to ensure everything is working correctly.

## âœ… Quick Status Check

Your system is **WORKING**! The demo successfully tested:

- âœ… User profile creation (3 profiles)
- âœ… Credential type definition (2 types)
- âœ… Credential issuance (2 credentials)
- âœ… Credential sharing (1 shared)
- âœ… Credential verification (1 verified)
- âœ… Issuance request workflow (1 request processed)

## ðŸš€ Testing Methods

### 1. **Interactive Demo (Recommended for Initial Testing)**

Run the comprehensive interactive demo that tests the complete credential lifecycle:

```bash
npm run demo:credentials
```

This demo:

- Creates user profiles for different roles (issuer, holder, verifier)
- Defines credential types with schemas
- Issues credentials with encrypted data
- Demonstrates credential sharing with permissions
- Shows credential verification workflows
- Tests issuance request approval process

### 2. **Unit Tests (Automated Testing)**

Run the automated test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Current test coverage:

- âœ… TokenService (JWT token generation)
- âœ… CredentialService (all major functions)
  - User profile management
  - Credential type creation
  - Credential issuance and retrieval
  - Credential sharing
  - Credential verification
  - Issuance request workflow

### 3. **Start the Full Application Server**

Start the complete application to test the REST API endpoints:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` with the following endpoints:

#### Authentication Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main login page
- `POST /login` - Polkadot wallet authentication
- `GET /callback` - OAuth callback handling

#### Credential API Endpoints

- `POST /api/credentials/profiles` - Create user profile
- `GET /api/credentials/profiles/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/credentials/profiles/me` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/credentials/types` - Create credential type
- `GET /api/credentials/types` - List active credential types
- `GET /api/credentials/types/:id` - Get specific credential type
- `POST /api/credentials/credentials` - Issue credential
- `GET /api/credentials/credentials` - List user credentials
- `GET /api/credentials/credentials/:id` - Get specific credential
- `GET /api/credentials/credentials/:id/data` - Get credential data
- `POST /api/credentials/credentials/:id/share` - Share credential
- `GET /api/credentials/credentials/shared` - List shared credentials
- `POST /api/credentials/credentials/:id/verify` - Verify credential
- `POST /api/credentials/issuance-requests` - Create issuance request
- `GET /api/credentials/issuance-requests/pending` - List pending requests
- `POST /api/credentials/issuance-requests/:id/approve` - Approve request
- `POST /api/credentials/issuance-requests/:id/reject` - Reject request

### 4. **API Testing with curl**

Here are example API calls to test the endpoints:

#### Test User Profile Creation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/credentials/profiles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "bio": "Test bio"
  }'
```

#### Test Credential Type Creation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/credentials/types \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "University Degree",
    "description": "Academic degree credential",
    "schema_version": "1.0.0",
    "schema_definition": "{\"type\": \"object\"}",
    "required_fields": ["degree", "institution"],
    "optional_fields": ["gpa"],
    "validation_rules": {}
  }'
```

#### Test Credential Issuance

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/credentials/credentials \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "user_address": "5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty",
    "credential_type_id": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_TYPE_ID",
    "credential_data": {
      "degree": "Bachelor of Science",
      "institution": "Test University",
      "gpa": 3.8
    }
  }'
```

### 5. **Other Demo Scripts**

Run additional specialized demos:

```bash
# Kusama network testing
npm run demo:kusama

# Security testing
npm run demo:security

# Modular architecture testing
npm run demo:modular
```

### 6. **Development Tools**

```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Code formatting
npm run format

# Build the application
npm run build:all
```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

Make sure you have the required environment variables set:

```bash
# Required for encryption
export DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-encryption-key"

# Required for JWT tokens
export JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-key"

# Database path (optional, defaults to ./data/sso.db)
export DATABASE_PATH="./data/sso.db"

# Server port (optional, defaults to 3000)
export PORT=3000
```
